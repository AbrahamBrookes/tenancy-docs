# Custom Database Connections {#custom-database-names}

To set a specific database connection for a tenant, set the `_tenancy_db_connection` key in the tenant's storage. The connection's database name will be still replaced by the tenant's database name. You can [customize that]({{ $page->link('custom-database-names') }}) too.
